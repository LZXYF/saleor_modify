GraphQL API (Beta)
====================

.. note::

    The GraphQL API is in the early version. It is not yet fully optimized against database queries and some mutations or queries may be missing.


Saleor provides a GraphQL API which allows to query and modify the shop's data in an efficient and flexible manner. You can `preview it here <https://demo.getsaleor.com/graphql/>`_.

Learn more about GraphQL language and its concepts on the `official website <https://graphql.org>`_.


Endpoint
--------
API is available under ``/graphql`` endpoint. Requests must be sent using HTTP ``POST`` method and ``application/json`` content type.

With the ``DEBUG=True`` setting enabled, Saleor exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under ``/graphql``, that allows accessing the API from the browser.


Example Query
-------------

Querying for data in GraphQL can be very easy with tool GraphiQL, which can be used from a web browser.

Here is an example query that fetches three products:

.. code-block:: html

    query {
      products(first: 3){
        edges {
          node {
            name
            price {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

results in the following result:

.. code-block:: html

    {
      "data": {
        "products": {
          "edges": [
            {
              "node": {
                "name": "Ford Inc",
                "price": {
                  "amount": 64.98
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "node": {
                "name": "Rodriguez Ltd",
                "price": {
                  "amount": 18.4
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "node": {
                "name": "Smith Inc",
                "price": {
                  "amount": 48.66
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

Authorization
----------------------------
By default, you can query for public data such as published products or pages. To fetch protected data like orders or users, you need to authorize your access. Saleor API uses a `JWT token <https://jwt.io/>`_ authentication mechanism. Once you create a token, you have to include it as a header with each GraphQL request.

The authorization header has the following format:

.. code-block:: html

    Authorization: JWT token

Create a new JWT token with the ``tokenCreate`` mutation:

.. code-block:: html

    mutation {
      tokenCreate(email: "admin@example.com", password: "admin") {
        token
      }
    }

Verification and refreshing the token is straightforward:

.. code-block:: html

    mutation tokenVerify($token: String!) {
      verifyToken(token: $token) {
        payload
      }
    }

.. code-block:: html

    mutation tokenRefresh($token: String!) {
      tokenRefresh(token: $token) {
        token
        payload
      }
    }
