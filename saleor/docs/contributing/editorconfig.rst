EditorConfig
============

`EditorConfig <http://editorconfig.org/>`_ is a standard configuration file that aims to ensure consistent style across multiple programming environments.

Saleor's repository contains an `.editorconfig file <https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/blob/master/.editorconfig>`_ that describes our formatting requirements.

Most editors and IDEs support this file either directly or via plugins. Consult the `list of supported editors and IDEs <http://editorconfig.org/#download>`_ for instructions.

Please make sure that your programming environment respects the contents of this file and you will automatically get correct indentation, encoding, and line endings.
